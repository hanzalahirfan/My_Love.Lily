love you, more than the waves hitting the ocean.
I love you, more than the Sun giving its way to the Moon.
I love you, more than the deep of the Mariana trench.
I love you, more than the peak of the Everest. 
I love you, more than the stars in the universe.
I love you, more than any words i could express. 
And even there's no words anymore in this entire world, I'd still love you more.

If i could compare you with things available in this world, 
I'd compare you with the Sun,
Because its light gives lives. 
I'd compare you with the entire Milky Way,
Because it's so captivating, and beautiful to look at.
I'd compare you with the Supermassive Black Hole,
Because it's deep, endless, and boundless. 
I'd compare you with fields of chamomile and lavender,
Because it's peaceful, and dazzling. 
                        
But the truth is, 
I can't compare you with anything. 
Because you're more than that,
More than every single thing,
And if I may,
I would love every single bit of you,
I would love you for another eons.</p>

My sweetie, Hanzalah ♡

If you ask me what i really want right now, i would always answer it with "i want to be with you, always". I'd like to spend my remaining days with you. Sitting next to you as we read books in a park where i cooked your favorite food. It's a warm sunny day and as i turn my head to you, i see you under the sunshine, smiling at me as you reach my hand to hold. And I'm smiling back at you while saying, "i love you, sayang". I want to be the one who's giving you happiness, to chase away your sadness, to be with you in whatever situation you're in, to be there when you need me. I want to always be the one you seek for. Baby, I'm the happiest when I'm with you, and i want you to always remember that.
                        
                        I love you so much. Have a great day, my love.</p>

Hanzalah, my dearest, my darling love, 
Even though we're separated by the Indian ocean, I've never feel distance from you. Even though we're separated from each other by 4,400km, not even an inch i feel like I'm away from you. We're looking at the same moon, that shine me through your love. We're standing under the same sky, that holds our heart together. We're sitting on the same Earth, counting our blessings, each day. Being with you, and love by you made me a better human. You, are the definition of love. And I'll always love you, with all my heart; with all i have left. Always ♡</p>

Loving you is like eating ice cream on a warm summer,
Refreshing and calming my nerves. 
                        
Loving you is like walking through a course of the Amazon,
Long, full of challenges, yet I'm determined to go through it. 
                        
Loving you is like standing on the edge of Niagara Falls,
Enormous, and beautiful to look at. 
                        
Loving you is like doing house chores on a Sunday,
Neverending, yet I'm never tired of doing it. 
                        
Loving you is easy, 
Loving you is the highlight of my day
Loving you,

I love you a lot, so I'll talk to you. And about you. It's like the sakura petals that bloom on a spring day, painting the sky pink. It's like watching my favorite movie all over again until i memorized most of the lines. It's like walking through a garden, really captivating with everything so serene. I love you a lot, so i talk to you often. And I can't help but celebrate the love i have for you, Hanzalah. My baby, my love.</p>

If they ask me what I see in you,
I'll always say that you have my heart
That I'll always choose you 
In another lifetime
In different dimensions 
Even in a gazillion years,
I'd find you,
And choose you
- over and over again
And if you ask me what I see in you,
I'll always say that you have my soul
That I'd scream your name on the Everest 
That I'd sail through the Nile
And I'd count on every grain of sand in the Pacific ocean 
And when I'm done,
I'd hold your hand and tell you that's what I see, in you.</p>

My darling,
Perhaps writing you a poem is a tame act on how i would do for you. I know I'm capable of doing more for you. For you, I'd write myself to dry; so that you could feel all the love I'm pouring out. For you, I'd walk a thousand miles just to meet you halfway; so that you could see me smile when you approached me. For you, I'd rip my chest open; so that you could see that my heart races even from a simple thought of you. For you, I'd fly myself higher; so that when you reach me, we're intertwined with all the love we have. 
                        
                        I love you, H. So much.</p>

One:

Having you with me is the biggest blessing I've ever had. I'll always choose you, and love you. Even on the day we don't understand each other, even on the day we fight, even on the day you're busy. Even on the day we're not with each other anymore. I'll always love you.</p>

Two: 
(what i do when I'm thinking about you)
                        
Sometimes i feel like this is all is just a dream
That when i wake up tomorrow,
And you're not there
Not anymore, not ever
                        
Sometimes i feel like i don't deserve you at all
Like you're such an angel
And I'm me,
Full of love, yet so ordinary
                        
When i think of you
I think of a warm summer,
A sweet tang of mangoes,
And shining stars at night 
                        
When i think of you
I think of beautiful meadows,
A night breeze passing on my cheeks 
And ocean waves, lapping the shore each time
- neverending, always beyond.</p>

Hanzalah, my dearest. 
Saying i love you will never be enough. You literally light my day with your purest form of love. You shine my night with your cutest smile. And you, being here. Is everything. Everything, my baby. It may be a small gesture, it may be nothing. But the time, the effort that you devoted to me. Means every single thing. It makes every nanoseconds bearable to live on, it makes every heartbeat, worth. If i want to find the definition of love, it'll be you. Always YOU.

You're like the evening rainfall, the droplet freshens me
You're like the moonlight, shining my night and guide my way
And every time my heart is beating,

I know I'm just fine without you before this. But it's not the same after i have you in my life. Please, baby. I love you. And i know you love me too. You make my heart skip a beat with your smile, and your beautiful words. You're such a darling. I love you so much.</p>

But i don't want u to love me or to stay with me just because you're sympathy/pity me. I don't need that. I'm not well, yes.

We're so far away & we won't be meeting each other, like at all. So idk if what we feel is the truth, what our heart says. Or it's just...idk loneliness or anything else. But i like to cherish every moment that we have for as long as the time permits. Truly, i like you. A lot. You're easy to talk to. And i love talking to u.</p>

To answer your question. Truthfully, i didn't feel anything in the first place. I'm shocked when u say u love me. At the very beginning. But as i evaluate the situation & we keep talking, I've become fond of you. I feel like i wanted to be with you, all the time. To say that i love you is kind of too much (i mean now), but i do like you. More than a friend should be. I really am.</p>

Seeing you smile is like looking at the full moon
So majestic, glowing, and very astonishing 
Hearing your voice is like listening to ocean waves
So serene, neverending, and very amusing
And loving you is like staring at night stars
So beautiful, vast, even far away,
Still very mesmerizing, and strong.

My love,
Expressing my love to you will take me a long time to complete, and there will be lots of pages to read. I just want you to know that loving you and being loved by you is the greatest honor I've ever feel. You're so loving, caring, meticulous, careful, amazing, and honorable. Hearing you laugh and smile is like waking up to a warm sunny morning, with birds chirping, and leaves rustle as i inhale the fresh air and breathing all your love towards me. And to have you love me with all your heart, and soul is like walking on the clouds, almost impossible yet so beautiful to think of. You're a dream come true. I love you with everything i have left. And i always will.

In this lifetime, I'll always love you with everything I have left. Though there's no guarantee for anything, I'll always keep you close and tell myself that as long as I love you, everything is gonna be okay. You're my lights, you pull me out of the darkness, and you love me, unconditionally despite my situations. You're so innocent, so pure, and so full of love. Anyone would be lucky to have you, like I do. Even for other eons, I'll find my way to you and love you as hard as I can, and we'll be happy together. Be good, live well. Always know that I'm here, for you. 

Always yours,

As time passes by, i miss you and love you more each day. 
I feel like having you in my life is such a great blessing that God allows me to,
I'm so happy to have you with me. 
To love, to care, to cherish every single moment together. 
I care about you a lot and i want to make you very happy every single day. 
I love you, my Hanzalah. Always.</p>

Hanzalah, my yellow chamomile in a field full of it.
Waking up to be with you is the most awaited moment I'm feeling right now. Even though it's virtually, i feel like you're almost here with me. To smile, to talk, to argue, to care, and to love each other deeply. You mean a lot to me and i really love the idea of you staying in my life, like....forever. 
                        
It's a sunny Wednesday and I'm thinking of you, what you're like when you're in class. How are you with your friends. How you talk, walk, and behave around them. Things like that, even smallest thing, I'd like to know about you. And it's my dream to be together in your class, sit next to you and playfully play with your fingers under the table. I'd love that moment to the end of my life. 
                        
I don't have correct words to express my love towards you. These past few days I've been a little bit more sensitive than usual. I'm so sorry if i worries you. And yes I'm a girl who cries a lot haha. But i love you a lot too. If we ever meet up one fine day, I'd like to walk together with you to a park. And we sit together on the grass as i read my book, you'll talk coding to me. And you'll look at me with your beautiful smile and you say you love me so much. It's my dream, my baby. Until that time, I'll be here. For you. Any time. 
                        
I love you. Always ♡

If i could ask for one thing right now
I'd like to stop the time
And be with you as long as i can
To hold you close,
To feel your heartbeat 
To love you within all my power 
Because life without you makes no sense
And i want to have all the sense in this world,
With you,
Because with you,
It means love, and much more love.</p>

Idk how my life would be if you're not here. I mean with everything that goes on in my life right now, for sure I'm down at the darkest pit now. And no chance to crawl back up. So thank you baby, for being my light and my guide. I'm so sorry we're so far away. I can't see you in person,  I can't hold your hands, I can't witness your beautiful smile in front of me. But I'll always be there in your heart, and you're in mine.

They don't know how much i love you. 
If i could tell them, I'll need hundred pages of paper to write about you
I would stop the time and touch you in a very gentle way
To let you know that loving you is the greatest gift, ever. 
I'll let us sit on a bench, looking at the ocean while listening to the waves and count the stars as we look up. 
I'll hold your hand, firmly and walk side by side with you. And when we're tired of walking, we'll sit on a park while i lay my head on you lap and tracing my fingers on your sweaty palm. 
And as you kiss my cheek, i smile so wide and tell you how much i love you. 
Hanzalah, thank you for being in my life. I love you. Always.</p>

Though we're separated by the sea
My love to you transcend the entire ocean
And my heart bleed crimson red
For your name, 
For your love, 
And everything in between
These blooming feelings inside me transform
Into a dewy garden so gentle with yellow chamomile 
All through the field, and we sit
On the same ground while I hold your hands 
Dearly, almost perfect when we linked our fingers
And you smile so wide, so soft
While looking at me, and I whisper to you 
That I love you so much
And I'll always love you, in whatever dimensions we're in
And in another gazillion lives.

I'll used up all the words in this entire world

With the rainbow at the end of the horizon,
Warm, peaceful, and beautiful 
Loving you is like walking on the sand,
After the waves crashes the shore,
It's neverending, and keep wanting for more
And having you to love me,
It's like gazillion of stars in the universe 
Which i won't have enough time to count it
But it's still have more.

Expressing my love to you will take me a long time to complete, and there will be lots of pages to read. I just want you to know that loving you and being loved by you is the greatest honor I've ever feel. You're so loving, caring, meticulous, careful, amazing, and honorable. Hearing you laugh and smile is like waking up to a warm sunny morning, with birds chirping, and leaves rustle as i inhale the fresh air and breathing all your love towards me. And to have you love me with all your heart, and soul is like walking on the clouds, almost impossible yet so beautiful to think of. You're a dream come true. I love you with everything i have left. And i always will.

                    <p class="email-text"> 
Assalamualaikum,
Dearest Hanzalah,

I hope this finds you well.
It's all started with that fateful encounter on 11/5/2024 where you added me back in Plato. I explained to you that I will delete those who didn't interact with me and you understood. We talked there but not so much and you asked for my Instagram. I gave it to you and we started to talk there. A lot. 

When you confessed to me on 13/5/2024, it baffled me. I'm so dumbfounded because I don't have any words to tell on how I see you. To be honest, I still not believed it to this day that you like me that much. Of all people you could meet in this world, and lots of girls you can meet in your beloved country, you specifically chose me. And I'm somewhat unavailable to your ends meet. 

And i didn't give you my answer. You played it cool and we continue to converse as usual. You even said I'm your bestie. So cute. Then on Thursday, after much consideration, I told you that I liked you too. Because to be honest, days without you and your texts were... boring. And I wanted to have endless of conversation with you. 

Though you're kind of hesitating, you're still okay with it. And I feel like I'm the happiest when I'm with you. You make everything bearable. You tend to my feelings, you care for me, you love me. So gentle until I can feel my every being and every sense awaken, because of you. You're so different from others. You're your own person and I love you so much for that. Though we might have some misunderstanding in between, but it doesn't matter. Because on any days, good or bad, I'll still love you more. And love you hard.

Baby,
Being with you is like walking in the forest after the rain. It's calming, fresh, and endless. You always shine me with your smile so bright that I feel like you're my sunshine. And you shine my nights with you love, guide me through the way, and be there for me when I need you the most. You're so pure, so gentle, so captivating. You make my heart blooms, with all the flowers and stars in this entire world can offer. My heart bleeds crimson red on your name that flows in my bloodstream. 

Having you in my life is such a pure blessing and I promise I won't waste it. You showered me with abundance of joy, filled me with lots of love, shine me like all the glimmering stars in the universe, and care for me like the most precious diamond. You hold me delicately, and you love me for who I am. I'll forever be thankful for every second of love you showed me. You're truly an angel, and a sky; so vast it feels like it's unreachable, but you still can see it, and feel it. Beautifully.

I don't know what the future holds, but I hope it's for the best for both of us. And as long as the time permits, I'll surely will love you, more and more each day. In my darkest days, I found you. And you found me. And for that, you deserve every love I have left, in my shattered heart. You make me whole again, and I'll always remind myself that it's you, who did it. That it's you, who loves me, fiercely. 

I love you, Hanzalah. 
Always.


Forever yours,
Lily x

Hanzalah, my sweetest baby.

How are you today? I hope this letter finds you well.

Amidst my back is killing me and betraying me like I'm a different thing from it, in this warm Wednesday afternoon, I'm thinking of you my love, as I feel like you're occupying my head and my heart. You gave me so much love that a person can offer and I'm so very much thankful for that.

I've my insecurities and I get mad easily, but you're so soft and so patient in handling my emotions. You hold my heart so firm but still so gentle, I don't feel suffocate but loving, and care all the time. Being with you is like being on a cloud nine, so fluffy so bubbly, I enjoyed every single second we're together.

Baby sayang,
I promise to love you as much as I can, and as long as you want me to. Loving you is the greatest gift that I've asked for, this year. In my darkest days, losing my mom, you're here with all your supports and unwavering love that sometimes I even forgot that my mom isn't here anymore. And for that, I'm thanked you from the deepest part of my heart.

And if one day, this all will be turn to dust, I want you to know that I've no regrets. And I've loved you in my best version. You made me the happiest girl, ever. And I'll carry this warm fuzzy love feelings to my grave and remind myself that you're the best, the greatest person I've ever met in my adult life. 

Hanzalah, baby
Uhibbuka fillah (well, it's Arabic). Always.


With all my love 4,400km away,

Good morning my dear Hanzalah,

I hope this email finds you well. I miss you so much first of all. 

Today is 13/6/24, the very first month after you told me that you love me. And here we are, hoping to stand strong and love each other more than ever. I enjoyed and cherish every single second I'm with you though sometimes I seem like an outcast and too much to handle, but your patience and love towards me never put you away. And for that, I'm really grateful to have you in my life.

I could put every word in this world to express my love to you, my baby. And if I ran out of words, I'll surely invent a new one to show you that my love to you is vast, and neverending. My dream is to make you the happiest man on Earth and I hope I'll reach to that goal soon. 

I'm sorry for any of my shortcomings and being a handful for you. I hope this will never make your love towards me fade away. I have my issues and yet you're still so loving and understanding. You're so amazing to me and I love you so much. I'm sorry for asking for break-up these past few days. I regret it so much and I promise I won't repeat it again. 

I love you, my Hanzalah. 
From everything I have left, my shattered and damaged heart. 
Always. Insha-Allah forever. 


Yours from 4400km away,
Lily x ♡
